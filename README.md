# The Great Escape
I was doing a class on something about programming and the college thought ALICE was neat...I did not. I created this as my class final with permission before I even took 1 java class at the college. It is a 2d Game that mixes Pac Man and Snake concepts.

I did not have ai algorithm training and at the time did not know about the classic pacman algorithm so the AI is to hard.

I go on record to say Alice should never be taught to any programming class ever.
